# The Project

Here I apply some SASS for the styling and sample JS fetch from a JSON file.

This solution was for the challenge <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/OEKdUZ6xs0h99C38XVht" target="_blank" >Recipe Page</a> from <a href="https://devchallenges.io/" target="_blank" >devChallenges</a>

Here you can see a <a href="https://xxtbmfxx.github.io/recepi-blog/" target="_blank" >Demo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/XxtbmfxX/recepi-blog" target="_blank" >Repository</a>

## The development

I could use MD or MDX to do it but i didn't know how to at the time

- time spend: ~ 3 hrs
