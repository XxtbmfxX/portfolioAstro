# The Project

This took me more time than I expected but finally it a good learning experience for future projects that will came soon and will probably be more profecional than this

This solution was for the challenge
<a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Jymh2b2FyebRTUljkNcb" target="_blank" >Auth Challenge</a>
from <a href="https://devchallenges.io/" target="_blank" >devChallenges</a>

Here you can see a
<a href="https://authwithnextchallenge.vercel.app" target="_blank" >Demo</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/XxtbmfxX/authwithnextchallenge" target="_blank" >Repository</a>

## The development

- time spend: +20 hrs
- Reminders:
  - Read the documentation
  - When watching a tutorial try apply the learnings in the proyect
  - Add usefull commits to the project so you don't have to delete the entire project <p> (\* ￣︿￣)<p/>
