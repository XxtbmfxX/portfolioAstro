# The Project

I wanted to try some animations on this project. I like when there's little animations that make the site feel alive and not just a paper sheet

Here you can see a

<a href="https://github.com/XxtbmfxX/frontmentor_easy-landing" target="_blank" >Repository</a>

## The development

- time spend: +8 hours
- Reminders:
  - In this cases it's better to use vue or Astro due the little interactivity and the division by components thats is really helpfull for development
