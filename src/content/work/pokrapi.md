# The Project

I try the server side rendering in this project but I neede some functionalities to work so it didn't fit for the project itself.

I did something simmilar learning React Native a few years ago in a Platzi course

Here you can see a
<a href="https://pokeapi-mocha.vercel.app" target="_blank" >Demo</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/XxtbmfxX/pokeapi" target="_blank" >Repository</a>

## The development

- time spend: +15 hrs
- Reminders:
  - Keep things simple and they will work
